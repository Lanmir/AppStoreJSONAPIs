# 📱 AppStore Mock

A fully functional and visually accurate mock of the iOS App Store interface, built using UIKit.  
This project demonstrates modern `UICollectionView` techniques, interactive animations, JSON data and decoding, compositional layouts, diffable data sources, search functionality, and API-based content loading with pagination.
